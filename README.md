# Game of Life
A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Python and Pygame.

## Overview
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the mathematician John Conway. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

This implementation allows you to interact with the game by adding or removing cells with mouse clicks and starting/pausing the evolution with the spacebar. It also displays the current score, which is the count of living cells, and the time taken for stabilization.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Pygame library
## Usage
Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies (pygame).
Run the script.
Click on the screen to add or remove cells.
Press the spacebar to start or pause the evolution.
Close the window to exit the game.
